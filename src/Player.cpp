//Player class is a derived class from Monster. A player is basically a more complex monster.
//In addition to having similar properties as a Monster (with notable exceptions of exp and gold reward), A player will have exp, gold, an Inventory, etc. A player is also capable of levelling up. This ability might want to be extended to Monster for certain situations, but for time being, they cannot.
